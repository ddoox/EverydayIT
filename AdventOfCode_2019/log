Day 2:
24: I had problem with "input_file". With debugger I've noticed it was the same object as swap which  I've used as reference. After using "copy()" everything works fine.
Before I've thought that operator "=" does the same thing as copy :)
    swap = []
    with open("input", "r") as input_file:
        input_file = input_file.read()
        input_file = input_file.strip().split(",")
        for number in input_file:
            swap.append(int(number))
    input_file = swap
